# Multi_Armed_Bandid_Simulation
I was inspired by chapter 2 of the bookk 'Algorithms to live by' by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths.
This notebook runs through a classic explore/exploit problem in the form of a set of slot machines from a Casino called the Multi Armed bandit problem.
My own interactive simulation of the Multi-armed bandit problem visualized with Bokeh.
I dive into the ways to approach this problem and specifically into upper confidence bound algorithms.
Requirements to run the full notebook:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Bokeh
- handcalcs
